    <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to Voyage</h1>
    </br>
    <p>Voyage is a travel app intended to assist drivers with a list of directions starting from their current location to their destination. Voyage will also provide a list of traffic incidents that travelers should be aware of on their trip; as well as an image of the current traffic flow.</p>
    <p> <h4>How to get started</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone this repo to your device</li>
        <li>Once you are in the directory of this project, cd once again into web_server</li>
        <li>In the terminal type node src/app.js</li>
        <li>In your browser visit http://localhost:3000/</li>
        <li>At this point, you should have reached the Voyage site on your broweser, type in your start point and destination then click go!</li>
        <li>Last but not least, drive safe!</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p> <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Node.js</li>
